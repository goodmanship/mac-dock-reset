mac-dock-reset
==============

Full screen applications will disable hot corners and other dock functions.  This script will restore them for you.
Here is a discussion on the bug: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3203909?start=15&tstart=0

Installation
------------
- Download `resetdock.command` and move it to your desktop or your dock
- When your hotcorners functionality disappears, just open `resetdock.command` and hot corners will be restored


Extra Credit
------------------
You can close the terminal window automatically after the script has completed by following these steps:

1. Open terminal, go to preferences (command-,)
2. Go to Settings > Shell
3. Choose 'When the shell exits: __Close if the shell exited cleanly__'
